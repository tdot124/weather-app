# Weather App

This is my first project as part of the front-end module of the Manchester Codes software development bootcamp.

In this project I have built a Weather App user interface, developing my skills in React along the way.

This app fetches data from the Manchester Codes weather API based on a user search of UK cities.

`cd` into folder and install dependencies using `npm install`

## Using Weather App

The default city is Manchester. You can use the search box to search for a city in the UK you would like the forecast for. If the app cannot find the city you are looking for it will display an error message.
